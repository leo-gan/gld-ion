# Techniques

The implementation is an arena plus a few parsers. Nothing in the hot path
calls out to another Ion library.

## One arena, many lists

An `IonDoc` owns nodes, edges, strings, symbol records, limbs, float bits,
timestamps, and blob bytes. A node is four integers plus annotation and child
indexes. Containers do not embed children. `add_child` appends an edge and
links it from the parent's tail, which keeps field order without a second walk
to find the end.

Sharing a scalar node is safe. Macro expansion does that: each use of a
template copies the container spine and points at the same integer or string
node. Annotations that the template adds are copied onto a fresh node so the
template itself does not change.

Depth is capped at 1024. A deeper list, s-expression, or struct raises
`DecodeError.KIND_DEPTH`.

## Symbol segments

A local table is a list of segments. The first segment is the nine system
symbols. A local declaration appends a segment whose text lives in the table.
An import appends a segment that records the shared table's real symbols and
a count for the unknown tail. The table does not allocate a string per unused
id, so a `max_id` in the hundreds of millions stays small.

`Catalog.exact` demands one name and one version. `Catalog.greatest` returns
the highest version of that name. Ion 1.0 import rules use greatest when
`max_id` is present and exact when it is not.

## Equivalence

`ion_eq` compares two nodes.

| Type | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Annotations | Same texts, in order. |
| Struct | Same fields as a multiset. Order does not matter. |
| List and s-expression | Same values, in order. |
| Int | Same sign and the same limbs. |
| Decimal | Same sign, coefficient, and exponent. `1.0` is not `1.00`. |
| Float | Numeric value. All NaNs are equal. `-0` equals only `-0`. |
| Timestamp | Precision, offset, and every stored field. |
| Symbol | Known text, or the same unknown import. A local unknown equals symbol zero. |

## Ion 1.1 macros

A directive `(:$ion set_macros (point {x: (:?), y: (:? 0)}))` stores the struct
as a template. `(:?)` is a hole with no default. `(:? 0)` is a hole whose
default is the integer zero. `(:point 5 (:))` supplies `5` and an absent
second argument, so the expansion is `{x: 5, y: 0}`.

The binary form uses opcodes `0xE3` and `0xE4` for the directive, `0xE9` and
`0xEA` for placeholders, and `0x00` through `0x47` for a macro address. Opcode
`0xE0` inside an argument list is the absent argument. At the top level the
same byte begins a version marker.

## What the writer guarantees

Two encodes of one value with the same `EncodeOptions` produce the same bytes.
Binary output may differ from a particular input when that input used NOP
padding or different symbol ids. Ion 1.1 output prefers inline symbol text, so
it does not need a local symbol table. Ion 1.0 binary output emits one when
any non-system symbol appears.
